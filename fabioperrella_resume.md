## Experience

### Tech Leader at Locaweb

May 2006 - Present

Locaweb is the biggest hosting company in South America.

I stared in the company as a Jr developer and today I'm a tech leader.

The tech leaders code every day and also are the reference for the other devs, helping them to evolve and face the most difficult decisions.

Since 2009 I've been working in many SaaS/PaaS Rails projects as follows:

#### Hosting

Oct 2016 - Present (3 years)

Hosting is the main and older product of the company. This project is replacing the legacy provisioning system by the new one. We chose to release the pieces as its getting done. We built a system to synchronize the data between the legacy and new system, which helps to deliver small parts of the system frequently and avoid a big migration after the new system is done.

Main challenges:

- Understand the rules and the flow of the legacy system
- Deliver the small parts isolated (using feature toggles)
- Build a flexible and generic provisioning system to allow POs and MKT to create new bundle of features easier

Technology: Ruby, Rails, Redis, Postgres, MS Sqlserver (legacy DB), Docker, Markdown, Git, Rest, JSON api

#### E-mail

Feb 2015 - Oct 2016 (1 years 8 months)

Email Team was responsible to take care of 3 apps:

- Administration Panel (to create mailboxes, groups, alias, etc..)
- Provisioning (to install, enable/disable services, etc..)
- Webmail

Main challenges:
- add new features and keep legacy code working
- refactor legacy code
- update old version of gems
- support the amount of requests the system has

Number of customers: ~ 200.000
