title: Test-Driven Diet (TDD)
---

This post will tell a story about a diet that I discovered, kind of low-carb, and how/why I get there guided by tests. 

The term TDD comes from the IT world. It's a way to develop the programs guides by tests. First you write the tests which starts broken, we say it's red, and then you write the code to implement what the test is testing, then the test pass, we say it gets green. 

By the end of this post, you will notice some similarity of this with my diet!

## The origins of my diet

When I was a child I was used to eat a good amount of sweets every day. 

My mother was a great cooker and she used to prepare delicious sweets like cakes, pies, etc.

I also rememer eating lots of crackers, chocolate, and suggar thigs. And I loved bananas! I would eat from 3 to 6 a day, a lot!

Apart from that, we were not used to eating a lot a vegetables. I remember eating rice, pasta (I loved pasta) and many other types of carboidrates (this point will be relevant during this post).

These habits of eating suggar every day, persisted even after I left home, when I moved to an apartment near the University, with some friends. I used to eat bread, chocolate, biscuit, pasta, etc, every day!

## When I got the first warning

In 2014, I was living with my wife and we would trave to the US in July, but a few week before, I had a serious labyrinthitis crise, which I have never had before!

Because of that, we were obligated to cancel our trip and I stayed 1 month to fully recover myself from that!

Then, I did some tests to find out the root of the problem.

2 of them showed me that I would need to reduce the amount of suggar that I was used to eat:

### Test 1 - Glycemic curve examination

In this test, you receive a bomb of suggar and wait 3 hours to see how your body reacts producing insuline to digest it. 

My body had a small defect. It produces more insuline than the necessary and because of that, the level of blood glucose goes down very quickly, which causes hypoglycemia. 

When the level of blood glucose goes down in our body, we can feel dizzy, so it seemed related to the problem that I had before.

The doctor explained my that eatting a lot of suggar would force my pancreas to produce a lot of insuline and one day it would be exausted, which would cause me to be diabethic, because it would not produce insuline anymore.

### Test 2 - glycated hemoglobin

This blood test verifies the level of blood glucose in your body, considering the past 3 months. 

It's different from a simple blood glucose test which will show the level of blood glucose now.

The result showed me that I was pre-diabetic!

Remember TDD? My tests were <font color="red">red</font>, failing!

### I always practied sports and there were no parents with diabetes

I've always practiced a lot of sport, since I was a small child. This is something which would help to prevent being diabetic.

In my family, at least the ones that I know (because my mother is adopted), there are no cases of diabetes.

Because of these 2 factor, the doctor said that my only options were starting to take medicines to treat diabetis or changing my diet. I would have to reduce the amount of suggar drastically.

I accepted the latter as a challenge!
