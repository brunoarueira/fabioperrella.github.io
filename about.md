Hi!

I'm a senior software engineer, working with SaaS web applications in a large company for some years.

Most experienced with Ruby on Rails but also opened to new technologies.

I care a lot about code maintainability and tests!

I like to teach and learn by pairing, code reviews, writing blog posts, presenting talks.
